Showcases:
    Type annotations
    Integer Declarations, int math expressions, and output (has to be a variable or string)
    String Declarations, string math expressions, and output
    Bool Decalarations, bool math expressions and output 
    Demonstration of whitespace between statements not being very relevant (like in Java)

Integer block
{
int x = ~3?
int y = 4?
int one = x+y?
int two = y-x?
int three = x*y?
int four = x/4?
int five = y%2?
!x? !y?
!one? !two? !three? !four? !five?
}

String block
{
str x = "Fanum "?
str y = "tax"?
str one = x+y?
str two = x+"Fanum"?
str three = "Tax"+y?
!x? !y?
!one? !two? !three?
}

Boolean block, also showing how the language is flexible with whitespace
{
    bool x = true?
    bool y =false?
    bool one = x        &&         y        ?
    bool two = x || false   ?
    bool three = ~ && x?
    !x? !y?
    !one? !two? !three?
}

Whitespace demonstration
Horrors beyond comprehension - not using whitespace effectively
Note: There should be a space between a type and var name, var name and a =.
{int x =3? if (x ==3) {int y = 4?} else {int y = 5?}? int y = 6? int y = 7? if (x == 3) {int y = 8?} else {int y = 9?}?}
{!x?!y?}
